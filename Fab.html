<font color="#0000FF">Marcus:</font color="#0000FF"> Is it going to be a good show tonight?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Skye:</font color="#0000FF"> Well, there maybe some fireworks.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marcus: </font color="#0000FF">Why is that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Skye: </font color="#0000FF">The researchers have booked Sasha who thinks she is the country's top influencer and Jasmine – Who also thinks she is the country's top influencer.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marcus: </font color="#0000FF">Hmm that should be interesting.<p>

<font color="#0000FF">Skye: </font color="#0000FF">It fell over?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marcus:</font color="#0000FF"> Pushed over  -  by that rock band that were appearing last night<p>

<font color="#0000FF">Jo:</font color="#0000FF"> Hi, It is indeed, Please come in.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Sasha: </font color="#0000FF">Is there room for both of us? Quite pokey isn't it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jo:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh it's not so bad, we manage.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Sasha:</font color="#0000FF"> I am hardly used to just managing<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jo: </font color="#0000FF">Hmm, ok, but let's get started on your make-up. I have a list here, and you are?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Sasha:</font color="#0000FF"> I am what?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jo:</font color="#0000FF"> Sorry, I meant what is your name?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Sasha: </font color="#0000FF">I beg your pardon. Did you just ask me my name?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jo:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, I have to check it off the list.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Sasha: </font color="#0000FF">I can't believe you ask that. Do you really not know who I am?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jo: </font color="#0000FF">No, sorry, I don't<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Sasha:</font color="#0000FF"> You must have spent the last two years living in a cave!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jo: </font color="#0000FF">No, I live in a bedsit in Islington<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Sasha: </font color="#0000FF">Unbelievable! I AM SASHA, that's who.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jo: </font color="#0000FF">Ok, ok. Let me look at the list. Err Sasha who?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Sasha: </font color="#0000FF">(indignant) Sasha who!!! Sasha who!!!!<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Jo: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, Sasha who?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Sasha: </font color="#0000FF">It is just Sasha you moron. Just Sasha. Just the mention of that name will be enough for everyone in the word to know who I am. Except, apparently, for anyone living in a bedsit in Islington. <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jo:</font color="#0000FF"> I am sorry that I do not recognise you. I didn't mean to be insulting, I just don't keep up with celebrity gossip<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Sasha; </font color="#0000FF">What said about me is not gossip. It is just praise an admiration.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jo: </font color="#0000FF">Ok, I see. And what is it exactly that you do?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Sasha: </font color="#0000FF">When you said you lived in Islington, is that the one in London or is there another one in Outer Mongolia?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jo: </font color="#0000FF">It is the one in London<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Sasha:</font color="#0000FF"> So I assume you have no TV, no radio and no broadband and a phone that still plugs into the wall.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jo: </font color="#0000FF">I have an iphone 12<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Sasha: </font color="#0000FF">Maybe you should charge it up then<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jo:</font color="#0000FF"> Can we please make a start on your make up?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Sasha:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, I suppose so, where shall I sit?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jo: </font color="#0000FF">This seat over here would do just fine<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Sasha:</font color="#0000FF"> Would you mind cleaning it first please? I just paid 2000 pounds for this Brunello Cucinelli  dress.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jo: </font color="#0000FF">Really? My mum has one just like it. She bought it from Marks And Spencer's<p>

<font color="#0000FF">Paulo:</font color="#0000CC"> And what do you influence?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jasmine:</font color="#0000CC"> I influence people, and tell them what to buy and what to wear<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Paulo:</font color="#0000CC"> And you make money from that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jasmine: </font color="#0000CC">Yes, a lot of money actually,which is why I can afford to wear this  Brunello Cucinelli  dress.<p>

<font color="#0000FF">Marco:</font color="#0000CC"> Do we have another dress they can wear?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Skye:</font color="#0000CC"> No way! For one, neither of them would wear a dress we gave them and for two, neither one would change and leave the other in the original dress.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Marco:</font color="#0000CC"> What can we do then?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Skye: </font color="#0000CC">I have no idea but one thing is for sure, neither of them will go on national television like that<p>
